# Content library — UX Design craft

Reusable starting point for anyone joining as a **UX/Product Designer** on the
Glovo UX team (Staff, Sr, Ssr, Junior — the tasks below don't change much by
level). This is the library the team's first onboarding page was built from.

**Only for this craft.** If the new joiner is Research, Content/Localization,
or Motion — don't force this library onto them. Their Week 1 tooling overlaps
a lot (Workday, Slack, Confluence, Claude access...) but Week 2 and parts of
the Resource Hub genuinely differ. Until a craft-specific library exists for
them, ask the requesting manager for the equivalent content instead of
guessing, and consider saving what you learn as a new
`content-library-<craft>.md` next to this file for next time.

**These are starting points, not gospel.** Re-check with the manager that
nothing has changed (new tool, retired link, reorg) before reusing verbatim —
this content drifts as fast as any other internal doc.

## Week 1 — items (generic across the whole UX org)

  ],
  "peopleGroups": [
    {"title": "Meet the UX Design team", "checkable": true, "people": [
      {"id": "week1-meet-jack", "name": "Jack Coles", "note": "Intro to Food", "slackId": "USNLGLV8C"},

  "closingNote": "Along the way, you'll keep getting invited to meet more of the team 🙂 And don't stress about lunch — we all eat together at the office every day."
}
```

"Meet the UX Design team" is a standing intro round for every new Designer,
not specific to any one person — reuse it as-is, same as the Resource Hub
POCs. Only re-check names/notes if the team composition changed since this
was last refreshed.

## Week 2 — items + standing team-intro groups (reusable)

The "Key projects to shadow" and "Product Managers & Engineering Managers"
peopleGroups are genuinely person-specific (see `SKILL.md`'s intake
questions 6-8) and must be built fresh each time. But two other Week 2
groups are standing team intros, just like Week 1's — reuse them:

```json
{
  "title": "UX Research", "checkable": true, "actionPrefix": "Meet",
  "note": "Book a session to get closer to key insights and the current UXR studies.",
  "link": {"text": "UXR studies list", "url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/117zIgMw-9UApCd4Tvfe9J26Z46drZYUZhmpBxDXiriU/edit#heading=h.t8bq2d9pk90c"},
  "otherMembersNote": "Also part of the UXR team: Pablo Andres Margara, Alejandra Ramirez and Héctor Rebollo.",
  "people": [{"id": "week2-research-anna", "name": "Anna Kebets", "slackId": "U02NHDQSX0C"}]
}
```

```json
{
  "title": "Localization & Content", "checkable": true, "actionPrefix": "Meet",
  "note": "Get familiar with our localization and content guidelines and ways of working.",
  "link": {"text": "Localisation Hub", "url": "https://glovoapp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LP/pages/5598874014/Localisation+Hub"},
  "people": [
    {"id": "week2-loc-emilia", "name": "Emilia Porfiri", "note": "Localization — guidelines & WoW", "slackId": "U0AGEMRCZ7A"},
    {"id": "week2-loc-content", "combine": [{"name": "Diane Chang", "slackId": "U09CWUAQ4RL"}, {"name": "Emilia Porfiri", "slackId": "U0AGEMRCZ7A"}], "note": "Content design — guidelines & WoW"}
  ]
}
```

If the buddy is themself part of UX Research (or another team these groups
introduce), drop that person from the group so they don't meet themselves.

## Week 2 — items only (title and scope vary per person, see SKILL.md)

```json
{
  "id": "week2",
  "icon": "2️⃣",
  "title": "Week 2 · <team/scope name>",
  "blurb": "Go deeper on our design principles, and start shadowing real projects.",
  "items": [
    {"id": "week2-1", "label": "Learn about our UX principles", "links": [{"text": "View principles", "url": "https://www.figma.com/slides/8fifOtZDMVQvj7JJ9yf8gK/Design-principles?node-id=3-14"}]},
    {"id": "week2-2", "label": "Take a look at the main UXR projects", "links": [{"text": "UXR projects", "url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/117zIgMw-9UApCd4Tvfe9J26Z46drZYUZhmpBxDXiriU/edit"}]},
    {"id": "week2-3", "label": "Look at some Design Reviews from past projects", "links": [{"text": "Design Review docs", "url": "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uDu6XhzvBnr5NuKJv6lOgSLC7R79Uip5"}]},
    {"id": "week2-4", "label": "Get familiar with the Pintxo Design System (Figma & docs)", "links": [{"text": "Figma", "url": "https://www.figma.com/design/TuxClC4JIItgCYAZiafQBt/Pintxo-Design-System"}, {"text": "Documentation", "url": "https://pintxo.glovoapp.com/4a9248a45/p/262983-pintxo-design-system"}]}
  ]
}
```

Re-title `week2` with whatever this person's actual scope is (e.g. "Week 2 ·
Retail + QC" for a Retail hire), and build `peopleGroups` from scratch:
projects to shadow, the relevant UXR contact, Localization/Content contact,
their PM/EM(s), and a few more teammates — all real names, resolved to real
Slack IDs.

## After your first month (standard, trackable — required for every Designer)

```json
{
  "id": "month1", "icon": "🎯", "sectionLabel": "After your first month",
  "title": "After your first month",
  "blurb": "Wrap up your first month by getting familiar with how we evaluate and grow on the team.",
  "poc": {"name": "Francisco Romano", "email": "francisco.romano@glovoapp.com", "slackId": "U02C3RV08BX"},
  "items": [
    {"id": "month1-1", "label": "Complete the Competency Framework", "links": [
      {"text": "Competency Framework - How it works", "url": "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G0rygs6OAR3T231p3avjby0b9YvJ8JwH5HYRwrhXhO0/edit"},
      {"text": "Competency Framework - Self-Check", "url": "https://forms.gle/DBq26tMkNTBH16t69"},
      {"text": "UXD - Competency Framework", "url": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cAE7-Ry85PkH7JStDTut_1lewoMEl03LPGGXZ5ZK_7s/edit"}
    ]}
  ]
}
```

Unlike the Resource Hub, this module has no `trackable:false` — it counts
toward progress like Week 1 and Week 2. It's a required, standard third
module for every UX Designer (not just Design leadership) — always include
it, right after Week 2 and before the Resource Hub.

## Resource Hub — 9 modules (stable, `trackable:false`)

These rarely change person to person. Re-verify links/POCs are current, but
otherwise these can go in as-is.

The `okr` module needs the most editing per person: swap `<current half>` and
the Jira ticket. `spotlight` and the `okr-5`/`okr-6` items are only filled in
if the intake surfaced a specific OKR stream — that's not part of the
standard questionnaire (see `SKILL.md`), so by default just drop `spotlight`
